# Observations API Documentation

The Observations API facilitates users in creating observations for various sites, allowing the specification of existing site IDs or the creation of new sites if they are not available. Additionally, it enables retrieval of recent observations, access to all observations, fetching a single observation, and other CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations.

            "status": "success",
            "observation_id": observation_id
        }
        ```
        - `observation_id`: ID of the created observation.

- **Error Response**:

### Steps to Use

1. **Provide Payload Data**: To create observations, you'll need to send a POST request to the `/create-observations/` endpoint with the required payload. 
2. **Payload Structure**: Include observation data within the `datainput` object. Specify site ID for existing sites or create a new site by adding its details and setting `selectedSite` to 0.
3. **Understanding GeoLocation**: For new sites, use `longitude` and `latitude` for the site's location.
4. **Checkboxes**: Use boolean values (True/False) for checkboxes indicating checked groups.
5. **Observation Creation**: Upon success, the API returns the observation ID in the response.
6. **Error Handling**: In case of errors, the API responds with an error message for troubleshooting.
