# Observations and Images API Documentation

The Observations API facilitates users in creating observations for various sites, allowing the specification of existing site IDs or the creation of new sites if they are not available. Additionally, it enables retrieval of recent observations, access to all observations, fetching a single observation, and other CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations.

### Steps to Use

1. **Provide Payload Data**: To create observations, you'll need to send a POST request to the `/create-observations/` endpoint with the required payload. 
2. **Payload Structure**: Include observation data within the `data` object. Specify site ID for existing sites or create a new site by adding its details and setting `create_site_or_observation` to true.
3. **Understanding GeoLocation**: For new sites, use `longitude` and `latitude` for the site's location. Note SRID is set to 4326.
4. **Checkboxes**: Use boolean values (True/False) for checkboxes indicating checked groups.
5. **Observation Creation**: Upon success, the API returns the observation ID in the response.
6. **Error Handling**: In case of errors, the API responds with an error message for troubleshooting.

## Images use the same API for observations 


### 1. **uploading observation images**

#### Request Type: POST

#### endpoint: `/monitor/upload-pest-images/`

### Example payload

```json
{
  "user_id": 1, // if the user is not authenticated but exists in the db
  "pest_0:10": (binary),
  "observationId": 0,
  "siteId": "1"
}
```

### Additional Information

1. **pest_0:10** Represents a pest image. If uploading multiple pest images, it would be `pest_0`, `pest_1`, etc.
-  ":10" is the id of the group to which the pest should be uploaded to.
- ``` grouping ids 
    bugs or beetles: 10 (staging), 23 (production)
    Caddisflies: 11 (staging), 24 (production)
    crabs or shrimps: 4 (staging), 17 (production)
    Damselflies: 8 (staging), 21 (production)
    Dragonflies: 9 (staging), 22 (production)
    Flatworms: 3 (staging), 14 (production)
    Leeches: 1 (staging), 16 (production)
    Minnow Mayflies: 6 (staging), 19 (production)
    Other Mayflies: 7 (staging), 20 (production)
    snails: 13 (staging), 26 (production)
    Stoneflies: 5 (staging), 18 (production)
    True Flies: 12 (staging), 25 (production)
    Worms: 2 (staging), 15 (production)
    ```
2. observationId: the id of the observation to which the images should be saved to. A value of 0 will cause a new observation to be created.
3. siteId: the id of the site to which the observation belongs or should be attached to.
4. A siteId of 0 will cause a new site to be created. In that regard it is also optional to provide site information for e.g.
```json
    {
        "user_id": 1, // if the user is not authenticated
        "pest_0:10": (binary),
        "observationId": 0,
        "siteId": "1",
        "siteName": "test_site21", //keep the names unique
        "riverName": "test_river",
        "siteDescription": "test_description",
        "rivercategory": "rocky",
        "latitude": 0,
        "longitude": 0
    }
```
5. This endpoint also calculates the AI score of the uploaded pest image. The AI score at the time of documentation is 73% accurate.

### Success response returns:
{
	'status': 'success',
	'observation_id': observation.gid,
	'site_id': site.gid,
	'pest_image_id': pest_image.id,
