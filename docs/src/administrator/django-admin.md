# Django Administration Site

This site is the administration site for the miniSASS platform, and only specific superusers can access it and in turn have the ability to make changes on it.

## Important Tables to Manage

There are a variety of tables to manage on the Django Admin site but the two key ones are the [Users Table](#users-table) and the [Observations Table](#observations-table).

### Users Table
<!-- Main focus on changing novice user to expert user -->

### Observations Table
<!-- Validating images that are dirty -->

## Other Tables to Manage

There are other tables that can be managed by administrative users and these are the [Group Scores](#group-scores), [Mobile Apps](#mobile-apps), and [Videos](#videos)

### Group Scores
<!-- Shouldn't need to be changed but can be -->

### Mobile Apps
<!-- Current version where app can be added, can add new apk if needed -->

### Videos
<!-- can store videos, but we'd have to do front end work to display them -->

## General Table Management

All of the tables on the administration site follow similar structures and as such can be managed in similar ways.
