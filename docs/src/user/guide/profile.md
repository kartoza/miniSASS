title: miniSASS
summary: The mini stream assessment scoring system (miniSASS) is a simple and accessible citizen science tool for monitoring the water quality and health of stream and river systems. You collect a sample of aquatic macroinvertebrates (small, but large enough to see animals with no internal skeletons) from a site in a stream or river. The community of these aquatic macroinvertebrates present then tells you about the water quality and health of the stream or river based on the concept that different groups of aquatic macroinvertebrates have different tolerances and sensitivities to disturbance and pollution.
