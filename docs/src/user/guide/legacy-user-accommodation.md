summary: The mini stream assessment scoring system (miniSASS) is a simple and accessible citizen science tool for monitoring the water quality and health of stream and river systems. You collect a sample of aquatic macroinvertebrates (small, but large enough to see animals with no internal skeletons) from a site in a stream or river. The community of these aquatic macroinvertebrates present then tells you about the water quality and health of the stream or river based on the concept that different groups of aquatic macroinvertebrates have different tolerances and sensitivities to disturbance and pollution.

# Legacy User Accommodation (Account Merge Process)

When you receive an email notifying you about account merging, it is important to understand the process and what it entails. Here's a guide to help you navigate through this process:

## Why am I Receiving this Email?

- You are receiving this email because our system has detected multiple accounts associated with the same email address.

- To ensure data accuracy and streamline your experience, we are merging these duplicate accounts into one.

## What Happens During the Account Merge Process?

- Our system will identify all duplicate accounts linked to your email address.

- Among these duplicates, first account will be selected as the primary account, and all related data will be consolidated under this account.

- Any redundant or duplicate accounts will be disposed of to maintain data integrity and reduce clutter in our system.

## What Happens After Account Merge?

- After the merge process is completed, you will have a single, consolidated account that contains all your information and data from the duplicate accounts.

- Your login credentials, preferences, and other account settings will remain unchanged.

- You can continue using the platform as usual with your merged account.

## Email Notification:

- After the account merge process is completed, you will receive a notification email confirming the merge and detailing any changes made to your account.

- This email serves to keep you informed about the actions taken and ensures transparency throughout the process.
