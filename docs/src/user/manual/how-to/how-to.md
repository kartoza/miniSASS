## How to stay safe when doing miniSASS

![How to stay safe when doing miniSASS](./img/how-to-4.png)

Ensuring safety during a miniSASS survey involves selecting a suitable site along a flowing stream or river, excluding stagnant water bodies like ponds or dams. Prioritise safety by choosing sites with diverse habitats such as rocks, vegetation, gravel, sand, and mud (GSM). Classify your stream/river based on its characteristics, identifying rocky or sandy sections. Always remember that the best site is a safe site. Keep track of your location using a phone or GPS for crucial information during the miniSASS survey. This ensures a secure and effective assessment of macroinvertebrate diversity in the water.

## Choosing a site to sample for miniSASS

![Choosing a site to sample for miniSASS](./img/how-to-5.png)

When choosing a site for miniSASS sampling, maximise habitat diversity by sampling various areas in the stream for 5 minutes. Engage actively in the process by kicking up rocks, gravel, sand, and mud to dislodge macroinvertebrates into your net. Explore under rocks, ensuring to wash the collected creatures into your net. Thoroughly scoop in and around vegetation to capture critters hiding in those areas. Stay vigilant for unique aquatic life such as clams, mussels, crabs, snails, and other species that may not be easily caught in the net. This dynamic approach ensures a comprehensive assessment of macroinvertebrate presence in different habitats within the stream.

## How to take a miniSASS sample

![How to take a miniSASS sample](./img/how-to-10.png)

To take a miniSASS sample effectively, start by running water through your net in the stream or using a bucket to filter out mud and grit, ensuring a cleaner sample. Transfer some river water to a tray and empty your net into it, checking for any creatures clinging to the net. Identify all the different macroinvertebrates using the dichotomous key, paying careful attention to each specimen. Mark each miniSASS group on your score sheet as you identify them. Once identification is complete, return all contents of the tray to the stream or river. This method ensures a thorough and accurate assessment of macroinvertebrates while maintaining the ecological balance of the environment.

## How to calculate your miniSASS score

![How to calculate your miniSASS score](./img/how-to-6.png)

To calculate your miniSASS score and determine the ecological category of river health, assign sensitivity scores to each macroinvertebrate group based on their tolerance to pollution and disturbance. High sensitivity scores indicate intolerance to disturbance, while low scores suggest resistance to pollution. Add up the scores and divide by the number of groups found to obtain the average score for the river siteâ€”this is your miniSASS score, reflecting the ecological condition of the stream/river. Note that an "Unmodified/Natural" ecological category doesn't necessarily imply drinkable water; additional chemical and microbial analyses are needed for water safety assessment. The miniSASS score specifically indicates the environmental health of the stream/river.

## Uploading your miniSASS score

![Uploading your miniSASS score](./img/how-to-7.png)

To contribute to the miniSASS database, register on the miniSASS website if you haven't already. Upload your collected data by clicking on the 'Submit Results' button and completing all the required fields. This step ensures your valuable observations are added to the collective effort of monitoring river health. Great job on actively participating in the miniSASS initiative!

## Using miniSASS for monitoring

![Using miniSASS for monitoring](./img/how-to-8.png)

After submitting your miniSASS data, monitor your submission on the map alongside others to ensure its accuracy. The color of the crab icon representing your assessment reflects the health of the stream at your site. Revisit the same site every 5-6 weeks to establish a time series, contributing to a robust global dataset on water quality and stream/river health. You can explore new sites along the same stream or venture to different streams to conduct additional miniSASS surveys, consistently contributing valuable data for enhanced monitoring and management of Earth's freshwater resources. Your ongoing efforts play a crucial role in maintaining the health of our water ecosystems.

5. **Water Research Commission:** The WRC was established in terms of the Water Research Act (Act No 34 of 1971), following a period of serious water shortage. It was deemed to be of national importance to generate new knowledge and to promote the countryâ€™s water research purposefully, owing to the view held that water would be one of South Africaâ€™s most limiting factors in the 21st century. In 1971 when the WRC was founded, water research and development (R&D) in South Africa was limited to a few institutions and the funding level inadequate. There was no research coordination and an apparent neglect of some key research fields. In addition, there was little strategic direction or leadership that would provide for the identification of priority areas or appropriate technology transfer. It was to address these issues, that the WRC was established.
